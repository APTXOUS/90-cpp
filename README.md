# 90-cpp

90-cpp is a series of funny C programming projects using CMD as GUI. Although they are written in C++, most of them only contain the C language features. 

All the projects are written by myself in my first year of program learning. Beginners can easily understand the logic in these projects and learn how to handle with their first project.

Every projects contains divided small steps to show you how I finish each projects.

1. Keyboard controlled [Hanoi Tower Game](89-b1) with CMD user interface.
